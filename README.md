edge-db-5
=======

This is a Sql compiler for edge.js derived from [edge-sql](https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge-sql "edge-sql"). It allows accessing databases from Node.js using [Edge.js](https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge "Edge.js") through ADO.NET 
At the moment two kinds of databases are supported: mySql and Sql-Server

This is meant to be used through [edge-sql](https://github.com/gaelazzo/edge-sql).
